Q: "what best products can men use and suggest me products to handle acne scars?"

A: For the best skin care for men, it is suggested to go for a gentle face cleanser with deep-cleansing formula and a moisturizer with an oil-free yet hydrating formula. Applying SPF is non-negotiable, so find a lightweight sunscreen with SPF 50 for better protection. Regular exfoliation is necessary to keep pores clean and healthy. So, add a nourishing face scrub and facial mask to your weekly routine. Gradually, you may introduce toners and treatment products such as serums and ointments to your routine if you have any particular concerns.

Mamaearth offers various face care products formulated specially to treat acne scars, blemishes, and hyperpigmentation. You may try skin care products featuring Tea Tree, Vitamin C, Aloe Vera, and Rice Water for the best results. It is necessary to be consistent with cleansing and exfoliation while dealing with acne scars. The sunblock is a crucial thing to stick with for effective results. In addition, you may also consider using MamaearthÂ’s Retinol Face Serum and Bye Bye Blemishes Face Cream. These toxin-free skincare products are formulated with natural skin-brightening ingredients that help reduce blemishes and old acne scars.
